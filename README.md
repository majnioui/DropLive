Just the original [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/Snapdrop), with complete Node.js server
Forked from [Node-Snapdrop]([https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop])

## Getting started

- To get started, clone and cd the repo:
- Install all dependencies with NPM:

```bash
npm install
```

- Start the server with:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Public Run

- If you want to run in your public "sharable" IP instead of locally, you can use this command:

```bash
node index.js public
```

> Remember to check your IP Address using your OS command to see where you can access the server.
